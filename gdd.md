# Game Design

Cursed World is a 2D political/war simulator where you manage and control a nation.

## Mechanics

Each game match will start with regions of random colors and sizes, to control your region you use the UI and mouse cursor.

To attack you select your region and click in a foreign region to attack.

Each region can spawn up to 1000 soldiers, 1 soldier is spawned after 2 seconds.

As your soldiers kill the enemy soldiers, your region border will fill the enemy region, if not your region will be retreated.

You can select how much % of your soldiers will be used in an attack.

## Diplomacy

Instead of attack, you can ask for an alliance.

It's good if you are weak and can't win some war alone.

## King

The king you will be a NPC that can be moved, if the enemy kill your king, you lost the game.

## Game Speed

The game will support 1x, 2x and 3x speeds.
