## Motivation

The current political RTS scenario is rich but very complex, killing the fun.

We plan to follow the Rapture World Conquest simplicity to balance between fun and gameplay diversity.

## Goals

- Implement countries with random territory sizes
- Government management
- Political scenarios
- Reasonable economy and market
- War alliances
- Natural disasters
- World wars
- Nuclear war
