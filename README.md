# Cursed World

A RTS game inspired by [Dummynation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892030/Dummynation/), [Rapture World Conquest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/547520/Rapture__World_Conquest/) and [Hearts Of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/hearts_of_iron_iv/)

The current political RTS scenario is rich but very complex, killing the fun.

We plan to follow the Rapture World Conquest simplicity to balance between fun and diversity.

## Goals

- Create a reallistic Earth globe and 2D map
- Implement countries with random territory sizes
- Government management
- Political scenarios
- Reasonable economy and market
- War alliances
- Natural disasters
- World wars
- Nuclear war
